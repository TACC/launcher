INSTALLATION NOTES

1) If the launcher will be used in a multi-node environment, place the source 
   directory in a shared location that is universally mounted.

2) Set the environment variable LAUNCHER_DIR to point to the launcher source directory.

3) If desired, add LAUNCHER_DIR to PATH.

4) Dynamic scheduling (the default mode) requires Python 2.7 or greater

RESOURCE MANAGER INTEGRATION

If the launcher will be on a system managed by a resource manager, set LAUNCHER_RMI 
to the name of the appropriate rmi file.

Example: For SLURM, setting LAUNCHER_RMI=SLURM will make launcher reference
${LAUNCHER_PLUGIN_DIR}/${LAUNCHER_RMI}.rmi

When building a custom rmi file, be sure to set the following environment variables:
  LAUNCHER_RMI_HOSTFILE
  LAUNCHER_RMI_PPN
  LAUNHCER_RMI_NHOSTS

LAUNCHER_RMI_HOSTFILE should point to a temporary file which should be populated with 
hostnames in the rmi plugin. mktemp is recommended for generating temporary filenames.
